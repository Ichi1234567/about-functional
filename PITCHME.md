### Functional Language

Suppose it is true that there is a problem which be solved only by functional language

Proof:

if a problem is solved only by functional language $\rightarrow$ there is no language to solve it.

$\forall$ functional language $\in$  interpreted $\exists$ a interpreter to handle

$\forall$ interpreter generates a machine language to run

$\therefore \not\exists$ a problem could be solved only by functional language

### Functional Language

* data type (as a set)
  * number, string, boolean
* syntax
  * operator: +-*/&|!% ...
  * condition
  * loop
